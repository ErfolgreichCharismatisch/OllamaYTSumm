A simple youtube summarizer using a local AI ollama server.
Today we have so much content online and so few time to be able to watch everything, that I've thought it would be cool to make a simple script to having a summary of the video previously to viewing it so I can decide if its worthy or not to see it. 

## Install
Remember that this relies on having already a running Ollama Server.

**1. Clone the repo**
```
git clone https://github.com/HariTrigger/OllamaYTSumm/
```
**2. Install the requirements**
```
cd OllamaYTSumm
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the script
```
python main.py
```
